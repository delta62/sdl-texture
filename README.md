# SDL Texture Demo

This project creates a basic SDL window which shows an image. You will need to
put an asset into `SandboxGame/res` named `mario.bmp` in order for the demo
to run properly.

This project has been discontinued as the libraries I want to use require C++,
but feel free to use anything you find here as an example of how to get a
working basic SDL application :)
